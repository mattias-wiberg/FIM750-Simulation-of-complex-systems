# SIR model
To simluate Disease Spreading using a agent based SIR model.

## Code optimization
Cellfun being really slow 54 calls taking 9.349s going to try to only using 
for loops to improve should be faster.

## Exercise 1
Most of the population seems to get infected at a value of &beta; > 0.21 for &gamma; = 0.01
as can be seen in the plot below where &beta; = 0.21 and &gamma; = 0.01.
